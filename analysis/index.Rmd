## Introduction

This contains a set of proposals for possible CAB meetings times to be voted on.
The full explanations, including the working and thought processes, are [here](./cab_meeting_time_proposal.pdf).

Meeting times for members are classified as:

1. Business Hours: 8am to 5pm meeting times
2. Outside Hours: 6-7am or 6-10pm meeting times
3. Horrible: 11pm to 5am meeting times

These can be considered as a reasonable description overall, despite some members finding a midnight meeting as quite convenient and a 6am start to be horrifying, with others being completely the opposite.
It is assumed that people should be *easily able to attend meetings during business hours* and can be *reasonably expected to manage outside hours meetings* as well.

All calculations below were made using the timezones contained in `OlsonNames()` and taking UTC as the reference timezone.

## Current Schedule {.tabset}


```{r load-current}
current <- here::here("data", "current.rds") %>% read_rds()
```

This schedule was originally devised by shifting the meeting in 8 hour increments every 4 months.

### Visualisation

```{r fig-current}
current + ggtitle("The Current Schedule") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

### Summary Table

### Key Points

- Just doesn't seem to work despite being great in theory
- Ironically places convenient times for Asia when Australians are on their summer breaks

## Fixed At 9am US/Eastern {.tabset}


```{r load-ny-fixed}
ny_fixed <- here::here("data", "ny_fixed.rds") %>% read_rds()
```

This proposal attempts to help Lori continually attend, as member of the Bioconductor Core Team and CAB secretary, by starting at 9am US/Eastern every month.
For some of the year, this potentially enables full attendance.

### Visualisation

```{r fig-ny-fixed}
ny_fixed + ggtitle("Start Times Constantly at 9am (US/Eastern)") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

### Summary Table

```{r tbl-ny-fixed, echo = FALSE}
cp <- tags$caption(
  tags$em(
    "Summary of meeting times for all members under the schedule fixing start times at 9am US/Eastern. Members in the Asia/Pacific region are the most strongly disadvantaged."
  )
)

        ),
        html = TRUE
      ),

### Key Points

- Relatively convenient for Lori, Janani & Stevie as secretary & co-chairs
- Highly inconvenient for Mengbo & Xueyi
- Also quite difficult for Nicole, Kozo and Luyi

## Setting Start Times By The Western-Most Members {.tabset}


```{r load-western}
western <- here::here("data", "western.rds") %>% read_rds()
```

This proposal shifts times every 4 months placing the western-most member of each region as the earliest start time (6am).
Until March, US/Eastern was chosen instead of Europe/Dublin as an attempt to slightly maximise attendance.

### Visualisation

```{r fig-western}
western + ggtitle("Starting at 6am By Region") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

### Summary Table

```{r tbl-western, echo = FALSE}
cp <- tags$caption(
  tags$em(
    "Summary of meeting times starting at 6am for the most western member of each region. 
    Members on the edges of each region are the most strongly disadvantaged."
  )
)
tbl <- western$data %>%

### Key Points

- Historically, after 10pm is difficult for most Americans, which motivated the shift to a 6am start for US/Eastern. Otherwise, all US people would be after 10pm and unlikely to attend
- Potentially quite difficult for Luyi & Kozo as meetings never occur during their standard business hours
- Also potentially quite difficult for Nicole

## Difficult Meeting Times in Empty Time-Zones {.tabset}


```{r load-empty-space}
empty_space <- here::here("data", "empty_space.rds") %>% read_rds()
```

This proposal attempts to place meetings which might start between 1 and 5am either in the Pacific, between Australia & the US, or between Eastern Europe and Western Asia.

empty_space + ggtitle("Difficult Meeting Start Times In Empty Time Zones") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

### Key Points

- The largest regions with no CAB members are between Melbourne and US/Pacific from April to Oct. This is during the northern summer and southern winter
- Once the next round of Daylight Savings shifts occur, this becomes between Europe/Helsinki and Asia/Shanghai as the southern hemisphere moves into summer.
- Those on the borders of these time zones will be disadvantaged, most noticeably:
    + Nicole, Mengbo, Xueyi, Kozo & Luyi
    + Leo, Lluis, Hedia, Johannes & Umar
- Also relatively convenient for Steve, Lori & Janani
- Has only two basic shifts from one pattern to the other & back
